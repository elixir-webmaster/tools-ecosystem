We are a background service that tries to link independent services and the metadata they generate in the field of research software for life-sciences. We aspire to be the metadata coordinator for life-science research software. A hub to collect and re-distribute information back to all services in sync.

To run our service we have the support of ELIXIR, a European organization with more than 22 countries members. However our progress relies on contributors. People that share the passion with us.

By joining our efforts you will be part of a very high impact initiative. You will also network with pioneers in the field, learn about job opportunities, sharpen your skills and if you are an exemplary contributor even bid for funding.
