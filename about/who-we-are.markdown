We are a background service that tries to link independent services and the metadata they generate in the field of research software for life-sciences. We aspire to be the metadata coordinator for life-science research software. A hub to collect and re-distribute information back to all services in sync.</p>
<p>
To run our service we have the support of ELIXIR, a European organization with more than 22 countries members. However our progress relies on contributors. People that share the passion with us.</p>

<p>
By joining our efforts you will be part of a very high impact initiative. You will also network with pioneers in the field, learn about job opportunities, sharpen your skills and if you are an exemplary contributor even bid for funding.</p>

<p>
In the animation below you can see how all these services are linked to our central repository. Metadata (green spheres) are contiously collected from these services and once they are synced and enriched (yellow spheres) they are sent to back to services. When there is an update, it is synced with all services. In doing so, the users have access to uo-to-date information from multiple access points. E.g., Suppose you want to use a tool for aligning sequencing reads to a genome. bio.tools offers an extesnvie list of such catalogued tools. With the Tools Ecosystem, the user form bio.tools can click on the tool they want and find information about benchmarking metrics, its maintenance and access-time, about workflows that use the tool, about its installation with bioconda, about its deployment in galaxy, citations and so forth. Bionformatic research becomes interconnected and open.</p>
